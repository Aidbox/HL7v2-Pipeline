# ADT Update patient information
# This trigger event is used when any patient information has changed but when no other trigger event has occurred.
# For example, an A08 event can be used to notify the receiving systems of a change of address or a name change.
# We recommend that the A08 transaction be used to update fields that are not related to any of the other trigger events.
# The A08 event can include information specific to an episode of care,
# but it can also be used for demographic information only.
